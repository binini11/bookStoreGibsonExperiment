          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Gibson School Book Store! We are dedicated to
            providing students with access to a wide range of educational
            resources. Our collection includes textbooks and reference materials
            for grades 1 through 12.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to support learning and inspire a love for reading.
            Whether you're looking for academic books or recreational reading,
            we've got you covered.
          </p>
          <h3>Our Team</h3>
          <p>
            Our team consists of eight seventh-grade Gibson School Lafto branch
            students who are aspiring to solve students' problems. This project
            is made for experimental bases for the science fair project. We
            would like to express our gratitude to fetena.net for the
            downloadable academic books we have used.
